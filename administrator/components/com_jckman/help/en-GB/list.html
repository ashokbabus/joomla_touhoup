The Plugin Manager controls what buttons are displayed in the editor's interface. It allows plugins to be published, unpublished, and assigned to specific tool-bars with the ability to setup user permissions.

In addition to these great features the Plugin Manager will also allow you to define three default parameters for the dialog popup screens: Height, Title and Width. And if this was not enough you can add further customizable options for your JCK plugins as parameters are just like any standard Joomla extensions!
