To restore a back it is very easy! All you need to do is click in the Restore's icon, navigate to the tar.gz backup file and click in the Upload File & install's button. Or if you want to migrate your configuration from one server to another, all you need to do is install the JCK Editor & Manager first, and repeat the above - job done!
