	 <description>Welcome to the next-generation of internet based editors. The JCK Editor's performance is truly amazing, thanks to its plug-n-play state-of-the-art API engine and is much more than an Out-of-the-Box installation of the CKEditor. Weve been under the hood and Joomla-ised its logic into a seamless and extendable integration.  Users can now customise the editor from the largest growing extension base of all Joomla editors, choose what tool-bars, setup user permissions, create and edit the editors own typography style-sheet and configure the editor for real-time editing! And whats more - when you have created your bespoke configuration you can now export your setting via the all new JCK Manager component!</description>
